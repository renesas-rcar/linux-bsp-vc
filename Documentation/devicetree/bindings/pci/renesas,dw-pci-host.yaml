title: Renesas PCIe 4.0 host controller bindings

description:
Renesas PCIe 4.0 host controller is based on the Synopsys DesignWare PCI core.
It shares common functions with the PCIe DesignWare core driver and inherits
common properties defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pcie.txt.

Required properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - renesas,r8a779a0-pcie  # R-Car V3U
  reg:
	description:
	 Specifies offset and length of the register set for the device.
         According to the reg-names, appropriate register sets are required.
  reg-names:
	description:
	 Must include the following entries:
	 "dbi"    - controller configuration registers
	 "config" - PCIe configuration space
	 "atu"    - iATU registers for DWC version 4.80 or later
  bus-range:
	description:
	  PCI bus numbers covered (it is recommended for new devicetrees
	  to specify this property, to keep backwards compatibility a range of
	  0x00-0xff is assumed if not present)
  device_type:
	description:
	 Set to "pci"
  ranges:
	description:
	 Ranges for the PCI memory and I/O regions
  clocks:
	description:
	 Contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  clock-names:
	description:
	 Must include the following entries:
        "pcie"
        "pcie_bus"
  resets:
	description:
	A phandle to the reset line for PCIe glue layer including
        the host controller.
  interrupts:
	description:
	A list of interrupt specifiers. According to the
        interrupt-names, appropriate interrupts are required.
  interrupt-names:
	description:
	 Must include the following entries:
	 "dma" - DMA interrupt
	 "msi" - MSI interrupt
  num-lanes:
	description:
	 Number of lanes to use
  snps,enable-cdm-check:
	description:
	 This is a boolean property and if present enables
	 automatic checking of CDM (Configuration Dependent Module) registers
	 for data corruption. CDM registers include standard PCIe configuration
	 space registers, Port Logic registers, DMA and iATU (internal Address
	 Translation Unit) registers.
