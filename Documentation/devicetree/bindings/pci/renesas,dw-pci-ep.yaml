title: Renesas PCIe 4.0 endpoint controller

description:
Renesas PCIe 4.0 endpoint controller is based on the Synopsys DesignWare
PCI core. It shares common functions with the PCIe DesignWare core driver
and inherits common properties defined in
Documentation/devicetree/bindings/pci/designware-pcie.txt.

Required properties:
  compatible:
    enum:
      - renesas,r8a779a0-pcie-ep  # R-Car V3U
      - renesas,r8a779f0-pcie-ep  # R-Car S4
      - renesas,r8a779g0-pcie-ep  # R-Car V4H
  reg:
        description:
         Specifies offset and length of the register set for the device.
         According to the reg-names, appropriate register sets are required.
  reg-names:
      - items:
          - const: dbi
          - const: dbi2
          - const: shadow
		  - const: atu
		  - const: dma
		  - const: app
		  - const: phy
          - const: addr_space
  clocks:
        description:
         Contain an entry for each entry in clock-names.
  clock-names:
        description:
         Must include the following entries:
        "pcie"
        "pcie_bus"
  resets:
        description:
        A phandle to the reset line for PCIe glue layer including
        the host controller.
  interrupts:
        description:
        A list of interrupt specifiers. According to the
        interrupt-names, appropriate interrupts are required.
  interrupt-names:
        description:
         Must include the following entries:
         "dma" - DMA interrupt
         "msi" - MSI interrupt
  num-lanes:
        description:
         Number of lanes to use
